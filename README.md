## Set up

Now, this is really complicated if you want to run it locally. Like really.

First, follow this guide:

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html

Second, you need to cover the following, including but not limited to (since there's a lot to do)

1. Basically everything in config/ (especially the database setup and email server setup)

2. Other deployment stuff.

Seriously, just email me if you need help.
